    <h1>Welcome to Protag Dev Studios</h1>
    <p>Your premier destination for cutting-edge games and innovative coding. Tired of the ordinary? Look no further! We specialize in crafting experiences that defy convention and spark creativity.</p>
    <p>At Protag Dev Studios, we embrace pushing the boundaries of artistic expression. Our team of dedicated developers, fueled by a passion for innovation, strives to bring you games that challenge norms and captivate the imagination. Introducing a curated selection of games that redefines the concept of "game." Whether you seek coding experiments or visual wonders, our offerings cater to diverse tastes.</p>
    <p>Our studio thrives on the synergy of coffee, creativity, and feline charm. Sleep is a notion we've left behind; it only hampers our coding endeavors. Our beloved mascot, "Protag," symbolizes our commitment to redefining norms. With distinctive features including brown hair, white skin, and a style that defies convention, Protag embodies uniqueness.</p>
    <p>But that's not all! We proudly present our magnum opus, "The Protag Collection" (TPC). TPC is a groundbreaking masterpiece that shatters gaming conventions. More than a game, it's a voyage into caffeine-infused minds. TPC offers an interactive realm that transcends reality, complete with fourth-wall breaches, mind-bending enigmas, and an abundance of glitches.</p>
    <p>Ready to delve into this realm of wonder? Click <a href="https://macecailiscool.github.io/protag-dev-studios/download/tpc.html">here</a> to embark on the journey yourself. Join us in celebrating the allure of unconventional design, enigmatic narratives, and the boundless potential of coding exploration.</p>
    <p>Stay connected for insights into our latest endeavors, as we continuously concoct fresh ways to redefine gaming. Thank you for selecting Protag Dev Studios, where the sole thing more surreal than our games is the idea of someone truly reveling in them.</p>
    <p>Our game development process is an art in itself. Commencing with a blank canvas, our creative chaos emerges through caffeine, cat videos, and keyboard symphonies. As the chaos coalesces, we embark on a coding odyssey that unveils uncharted realms of logic.</p>
    <p>And the journey doesn't stop there! Meticulously introduced glitches redefine gameplay. Why settle for polished graphics and smoothness when you can immerse yourself in pixelated dreams and controls that defy gravity?</p>
    <p>Sound design, a realm of its own, beckons our in-house maestros. Melodies born from chaos will linger in your dreams. Each off-note and jarring tone crafts an auditory narrative that's as unforgettable as it is captivating.</p>
    <p>Inspiration finds us in the ordinary, absurd, and bewildering. From mismatched socks to talks with garden gnomes, every facet of existence fuels our creative fire. Why settle for conventional plots and relatable personas when NPCs converse in enigmas and plot twists abandon predictability?</p>
    <p>We invite you to embrace the chaos, challenge preconceptions, and wander within the maze of our creations. Remember, at Protag Dev Studios, "normal" is just a cycle on a washing machine. So buckle up, savor your coffee (or three), and prepare for an encounter that will leave you questioning your own reality.</p>
