    <h1>Welcome to Protag Dev Studios</h1>
    <p>Your one-stop destination for mediocre games and questionable coding. Are you tired of games that actually make sense? Look no further! We specialize in creating experiences that will leave you scratching your head.</p>
    <p>At Protag Dev Studios, we believe in pushing the boundaries of bad taste. Our team of caffeine-fueled coders works tirelessly to bring you games that defy logic and aesthetics. We proudly present to you a collection of games that will make you question the very meaning of "game." Whether you're into coding disasters or visual nightmares, we've got something for everyone.</p>
    <p>Our studio culture revolves around coffee, chaos, and cat memes. We don't believe in sleep because it's just an excuse for missing out on more coding time. Our mascot, "Protag," is a digital embodiment of our commitment to confusion. With brown hair, white skin, and a fashion sense that even a thrift store would reject, Protag is the epitome of uniqueness.</p>
    <p>But wait, there's more! We proudly present our magnum opus, "The Protag Collection" (TPC). TPC is an avant-garde masterpiece that defies all gaming conventions. It's not just a game; it's a journey through the minds of caffeine-addicted developers. TPC is an interactive experience that transcends reality, with fourth wall breaks, mind-bending puzzles, and more bugs than you can count.</p>
    <p>Ready to dive into the madness? Click <a href="https://protagdevstudios.itch.io/the-protag-collection">here</a> to witness the chaos for yourself. Join us in celebrating the beauty of bad design, incomprehensible narratives, and the boundless potential of coding mistakes.</p>
    <p>Stay tuned for updates on our latest projects, because we're always cooking up new ways to challenge your understanding of what a game should be. Thank you for choosing Protag Dev Studios, where the only thing scarier than our games is the thought that someone might actually enjoy them.</p>
    <p>Our game development process is unlike any other. We start with a blank canvas and a chaotic brainstorming session that involves a copious amount of caffeine, cat videos, and keyboard smashing. Once the initial chaos settles, we embark on a coding journey that takes us to uncharted territories of logic and reason.</p>
    <p>But it doesn't stop there! We meticulously introduce bugs and glitches that redefine the gaming experience. Who needs polished graphics and smooth gameplay when you can have pixelated nightmares and controls that defy the laws of physics?</p>
    <p>And don't get us started on sound design. Our in-house musician (who coincidentally is also our coffee machine operator) creates tunes that will haunt your dreams. With every out-of-tune note and jarring sound effect, we strive to create an auditory experience that's as unforgettable as it is unsettling.</p>
    <p>We're often asked about our source of inspiration. The truth is, we find inspiration in the mundane, the absurd, and the utterly bewildering. From mismatched socks to conversations with garden gnomes, our team draws creative fuel from every corner of existence. Who needs predictable plots and relatable characters when you can have NPCs that speak in riddles and plot twists that make no sense?</p>
    <p>We invite you to embrace the chaos, challenge your perceptions, and lose yourself in the labyrinth of our creations. Remember, at Protag Dev Studios, "normal" is just a setting on a washing machine. So buckle up, grab your coffee (or three), and prepare for a gaming experience that will leave you questioning your sanity.</p>
